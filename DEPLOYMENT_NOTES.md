# Deployment Notes - SubSpace Security Update

## ‚úÖ Status: Ready for Deployment

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Build Status:** ‚úÖ Successful
**Dev Server:** ‚úÖ Tested and Working
**Security Level:** HIGH

---

## üîß Environment Setup Completed

### ‚úÖ Configuration Files Updated

**`.env.local` - Configured with:**
- ‚úÖ `DATABASE_URL` - Neon PostgreSQL connection
- ‚úÖ `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - deacon-admin-2025
- ‚úÖ `JWT_SECRET` - Generated secure 32-char secret
- ‚úÖ `RESEND_API_KEY` - Email service configured
- ‚úÖ `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` - forms@deacon.build
- ‚úÖ `EMAIL_ALLOWLIST` - Empty (allows all domains)

### üìù Optional Email Allowlist

If you want to restrict emails to specific domains only, update `.env.local`:

```bash
# Only allow emails to deacon.build domain
EMAIL_ALLOWLIST=deacon.build

# Or multiple domains (comma-separated)
EMAIL_ALLOWLIST=deacon.build,client-domain.com
```

---

## üöÄ Deployment to Vercel

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables

In Vercel dashboard, add these environment variables:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_osJK3upn2dBQ@ep-still-sea-afb15oix-pooler.c-2.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require

ADMIN_PASSWORD=deacon-admin-2025

JWT_SECRET=lnfLaBq1rRmGn0OVSNbLwsYh05/QJzYhSrJpOQkbZCo=

RESEND_API_KEY=re_SB8dJC6r_LZFeBhFoNDbcoA7YNdqFJ5rw

RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=forms@deacon.build

EMAIL_ALLOWLIST=
```

**Important:**
- Set these for **Production** environment
- Optionally set for Preview/Development as well
- Keep `JWT_SECRET` secure and never commit it

### Step 2: Deploy

```bash
# Link to Vercel (if not already linked)
vercel link --scope deacon-construction-team

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

Or simply push to your main branch if you have automatic deployments enabled.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### npm audit - Moderate Vulnerabilities (4)

**Issue:** esbuild vulnerability in drizzle-kit (dev dependency)
**Severity:** Moderate
**Impact:** Development server only (not production runtime)
**Status:** Not critical - can be addressed later

**Details:**
- Affects: `drizzle-kit` (database tooling)
- Vulnerability: esbuild development server request handling
- Does NOT affect production builds
- Fix requires breaking changes to drizzle-kit

**Recommendation:**
- Safe to deploy current version
- Monitor for drizzle-kit updates
- Address in next maintenance cycle

To fix (if needed):
```bash
npm audit fix --force  # Warning: may cause breaking changes
```

## üß™ Post-Deployment Testing

### 1. Test Authentication

**Admin Login:**
```
URL: https://your-domain.vercel.app/admin
Password: deacon-admin-2025
```

Expected behavior:
- Login successful with valid password
- Redirected to dashboard
- Can view form submissions
- Cookie set (check browser dev tools)
- Logout works correctly

### 2. Test Rate Limiting

Try logging in with wrong password 6+ times:
- First 5 attempts: "Invalid credentials"
- 6th attempt: "Too many login attempts"
- Should show retry-after time

### 3. Test Form Submission

**Public Form:**
```
URL: https://your-domain.vercel.app/forms/impalement-protection
```

Test cases:
- ‚úÖ Valid submission with all fields
- ‚úÖ Email sent successfully
- ‚úÖ Form appears in admin dashboard
- ‚ùå Try submitting without signature (should fail)
- ‚ùå Try invalid email format (should fail)
- ‚ùå Try very long job number (should fail)

### 4. Test Email Allowlist (if configured)

If you set `EMAIL_ALLOWLIST=deacon.build`:
- ‚úÖ Email to `test@deacon.build` should work
- ‚ùå Email to `test@gmail.com` should fail with allowlist error

### 5. Test Security Headers

Check response headers:
```bash
curl -I https://your-domain.vercel.app
```

Should see:
- `Strict-Transport-Security`
- `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `Content-Security-Policy`

## üìä Security Monitoring

### What to Monitor

**Authentication Events:**
- Failed login attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Successful admin logins

**Form Submissions:**
- Submission rate and patterns
- Email delivery failures
- Validation errors

**Security Logs:**
Check application logs for `[SECURITY]` entries:
- HIGH and CRITICAL severity events
- Unusual access patterns
- Repeated validation failures

### Vercel Logs

View logs in Vercel dashboard:
```
Project ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí [Latest] ‚Üí Runtime Logs
```

Look for security events logged by the application.

## üîê Security Best Practices

### Immediate Actions (If Not Already Done)

- [ ] Change `ADMIN_PASSWORD` to a unique strong password
- [ ] Verify `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` is verified in Resend
- [ ] Test authentication flow in production
- [ ] Verify emails are being sent correctly
- [ ] Check security headers are present

### Regular Maintenance

**Weekly:**
- Review security logs
- Check for unusual authentication patterns
- Verify email delivery success rate

**Monthly:**
- Review and rotate `JWT_SECRET` if needed
- Update dependencies: `npm update`
- Run security audit: `npm audit`
- Review rate limit effectiveness

**Quarterly:**
- Consider updating `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- Review and update security policies
- Audit user access patterns

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: Admin can't log in

**Symptoms:** "Invalid credentials" even with correct password

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is set in Vercel environment variables
2. Check environment variable has no trailing spaces
3. Redeploy after changing environment variables
4. Clear browser cookies and try again

### Issue: Forms not submitting

**Symptoms:** Validation errors or "Failed to submit"

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify all required fields are filled
3. Check signature is drawn (canvas not empty)
4. Verify rate limiting isn't triggered (wait 1 minute)

### Issue: Emails not sending

**Symptoms:** Form saves but email fails

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is correct
2. Check `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` is verified in Resend
3. Check recipient email domain (if allowlist is set)
4. Review Resend dashboard for delivery status
5. Check Vercel logs for email errors

### Issue: Rate limiting too aggressive

**Symptoms:** Users getting blocked too quickly

**Solutions:**
1. Review `lib/rate-limit.ts` configuration
2. Adjust `maxRequests` for form submissions
3. Consider implementing Redis for distributed rate limiting
4. Redeploy after changes

### Issue: "Unauthorized" when accessing admin

**Symptoms:** Can't access dashboard even after login

**Solutions:**
1. Check if `JWT_SECRET` is set in Vercel
2. Verify cookie is being set (browser dev tools)
3. Check if cookies are blocked by browser
4. Try in incognito/private window
5. Clear all cookies and login again

## üì± DNS & Domain Setup

### Current Setup
- **Domain:** deacon.build (via DNSimple)
- **Subdomain needed:** forms.deacon.build (or similar)

### Vercel Domain Configuration

1. **Add Domain in Vercel:**
   ```
   Project Settings ‚Üí Domains ‚Üí Add Domain
   forms.deacon.build
   ```

2. **Configure DNS in DNSimple:**
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: forms
   Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
   ```

3. **Update Environment Variables:**
   - Update URLs in code if needed
   - Update `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` if using subdomain
